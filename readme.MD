# Pyro Editor


My fun little text editor to encrypt all my darkest secrets :)

# Encryption Technology
I used my encryption library [jencrypt](https://github.com/jessebadry/jencrypt), which uses the rust crypto streaming crates, I cannot test the validity of the encryption, but this project is mostly
for fun.
